# WorkoutMate

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

**This app is not yet ready for use.**

------------

WorkoutMate is a free and open source (FOSS) alternative to apps similar to FitNotes, written in JavaScript via Svelte Native, inspired also by FitNotes.
As a former avid exercise enthusiast and gym rat, I have for many years written down my progress during planned workouts. My process was constantly evolving
as I experimented with various methods of keeping track of my goals as well as keeping track of the details of my workouts, including but not limited to the
exercise, amount of weight, number of sets, number of reps, and amount of time spent for mid-set breaks. I loved keeping track of this information; it helped
keep me goal-focused, as well as keeping me in the mindset of always competing with my former self. This app will attempt to maintain this philosophy.

There will be no data sent online anywhereâ€”your data is _your_ data, solely for your own benefit, and _you are not the product_.

## Ambition

I want this app to just as much be a helper during workouts as it will be for big-picture, long-term planning and the setting of goals. There may eventually
involve _gamification_ to spice things up as a sort of end-game feature (after the app's core features are implemented). 

## Features

- [ ] Workout session creation (a collection of exercises and/or stretches)
  - [ ] Create workouts by selecting existing exercises and/or stretches from a preexisting list.
  - [ ] Create custom exercises/moves/stretches, adding to the preexisting list of moves.
  - [ ] Create supersets.
- [ ] Customizable rest timers
  - This will be flexible in that: timers can be "injected" into the workout. The user will be able to add a rest timer to a workout as if it were an
  exercise/move itself. While maintaining that flexibility, it should also be easy for the user to "edit all" rest timers. Perhaps there can be multiple
  types of rest timers -- one called a mid-set timer, and one called a mid-workout timer... Flexible, yet simple. An interesting idea to include in the
  long-term planning aspect of this would be to allow the user to optionally automatically decrease the rest timer by `x` each time the workout is repeated.
  This is one way to gradually intensify workout sessions to improve endurance over time.
